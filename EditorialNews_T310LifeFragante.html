            <b>A forward-looking ATIGA</b>
            <p>ATIGA’s most significant outcome is the reduction of intra-ASEAN trade tariff to zero for almost all types of goods. To date, more than 98 percent of all tariff lines have zero rates.</p>
            <p>It is, therefore, timely to upgrade the ATIGA to respond to and stay ahead of these global shifts and align it with ASEAN’s transformative agenda. An upgraded ATIGA will further simplify the rules of origin for goods, expand the adoption of trade technologies and paperless documents, and harmonise technical regulations and standards. It will also facilitate trade for micro, small, and medium enterprises, address sustainability and circularity concerns, and promote digital trade.
            </p>
            <p>The parallel historical backdrops between ATIGA’s signing in 2009 and the launching of its upgrade negotiation in 2022 might be unfortunate. Yet, therein lies a golden opportunity for ASEAN to strengthen its place in a changing world.</p>

                <p>In 2018, I utilized this space to outline five essential points that argued strongly against the adoption of a SIM card registration system. I stand by those statements even as the country is now set to welcome an ill-conceived law on this subject.</p>
                <p>All those reasons I gave back then are just as valid today. The only difference is that the system our legislators ended up designing is much worse than the kind those arguments were meant for. How they managed to pull this off is remarkable.</p>
                <p>For starters, the coverage of the law is vague, especially when it relates to institutional SIM card end-users and social media account registration. Unlike most other statutes, it doesn’t define its scope. Take SIM card registration. The law explicitly says that an end-user can be a juridical entity. What it doesn’t say is how its sale and registration guidelines apply to such a user.</p>
                <p>Things get murkier with social media account registration. The law doesn’t even say who needs to register. Will the criteria for SIM card registration also apply? That’s simply impossible unless a social media platform requires all of its users to register, or at least prove their real identity. But if they do that, they might violate the laws of other countries where such invasive data collection is not permitted.</p>

                <p>TV companies have time to adapt, but they face a major challenge in catering at once to older people watching traditional broadcasts, middle-aged people shifting to streaming and young people wanting interactive and social entertainment.</p>
                <p>Up to now, TV firms have been insulated from tech disruption because their advertising revenue was largely unaffected -- unlike other traditional media like newspapers.

                    That could change "faster than people realize," said Warneford.
                    
                    It was previously hard to move TV ads into the gaming world because they were created by individual companies "who locked them down and captured all the value," he said.</p>
                <p>But with the more open field of the metaverse, brands will have much more scope to promote themselves and sell goods directly to users.

                    Indeed, fashion and luxury labels are already making millions selling virtual clothes and accessories on Roblox, Fortnite and other platforms.</p>
